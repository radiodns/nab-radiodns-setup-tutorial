# NAB RadioDNS Setup Tutorial

This repository contains the final code from a coding tutorial included in the
NAB RadioDNS Setup Tutorial session held in July 2020.

It includes a simple PHP script that you can use and adapt to build a compliant
RadioDNS SI file and image assets from a source MySQL database, directory of
station logos and an access token for the
[NRSC PI Codes](https://picodes.nrscstandards.org) Call Signs API.

The `radio.sql` file is a dump of the database used in the demo.
